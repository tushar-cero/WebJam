The Website is responsive across all devices and sizes with `smooth-scroll` navigaton. The idea of the design is to provide a good user experience to the viewers that visit the website. The goal is to make it easy for the viewers to go throught the entire Portfolio and give an easily navigable and easy to find the relivant information experince. The website is made using pure &nbsp;`HTML`, &nbsp;`CSS`&nbsp; and &nbsp; `JS`&nbsp;. It doesnot uses any Bootstrap Services or HTML Templates for Styling and Structuring. 

# Feature Function 

The website uses `Vanilla JavaScript` to add functionality to the website such as -

# Form Submission and Collection

The website is hosted on `Netlify` and uses `Netlify's built-in Form Handling` Feature to collect all the data for the form. It allows us to collect the form submitted in the website into our Netlify Dashboard and can be sent to the owner via email. Free version allows you to collect 100 submossion per month.

# 3rd Party Library

The webite uses a 3rd Party Library called `Smooth Scroll` made by the Github user [Chris Ferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi) which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll). It is a light-weight JS library that allows the website naviagtion links to scroll the website up/down smoothly rather then snapping from one section to another.

# Deployment

The website is deployed to the free-hosting service `NETLIFY`. Netlify is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.
