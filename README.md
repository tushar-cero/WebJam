# WebJam

> This is the source code for website to be submitted in WebJam, organised by CSI-DYPIEMR in collaboration with EDC-DYPIEMR.

It is a Single-Page Web-Portfolio. It is divided into the following sections - 
1. Header
2. Landing Section
3. About Section
4. Skills Section
5. Projects Showcase Section
6. Contact Section
7. Footer

The Website is responsive acroess all devices and sizes with `smooth-scroll` navigaton. The idea of the design is to provide a good user experience to the viewers that visit the website. The goal is to make it easy for the viewers to go throught the entire Portfolio with single taps on the screen making the website easily navigable and easy to find the relivant information. The website is made using pure &nbsp;`HTML`, &nbsp;`CSS`&nbsp; and &nbsp; `JS`&nbsp;. It doesnot uses any Bootstrap Services or HTML Templates for Styling and Structuring.

## Feature Function 

The website uses `Vanilla JavaScript` to add functionality to the website such as - 
- Menu Pop Up from the bottom
- Success Message Alert on form submission. 

## Form Collection

The website is hosted on `Netlify` and uses Netlify form collection feature to collect all the data for the form and send it to the owner via email.

## 3rd Party Library

The webite uses a 3rd Party Library called `Smooth Scroll` made by the Github user [Chris Ferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi) which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll). It is a light-weight JS library that allows the website naviagtion links to scroll the website up/down smoothly rather then snapping from one section to another.
